	"content": "Introduction of Amazon VPC Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) is a “Virtual Private Cloud” which is a custom virtual network located inside the AWS Cloud and isolated from the entire outside world. The concept is similar to designing and implementing a separate standalone network environment in an on-premise data center, which is still very popular today in many countries of the world.\nInside that custom VPC, you have full control over your virtual network environment, meaning both the ability to initialize and run AWS resources and the ability to select IP address ranges, create networks subnets and configure routing tables and network gateways. You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 for secure and easy access to resources and applications in the VPC.\nRegion is a concept that describes many extremely large clusters of AWS data centers located in a certain territory. Within a region, you can create multiple VPCs, and each VPC is distinguished by different ranges of IP address spaces. You specify the IPv4 address range by selecting a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), such as 10.0.0.0/16. The Amazon VPC address range cannot be changed once it has been created. Amazon VPC address ranges can be as large as /16 (ie 65536 available addresses) or as small as /28 (ie 16 available addresses) and they must not overlap with any other networks to which they will be connected. connect to.\nThe Amazon VPC service was launched after the Amazon EC2 service, so at some point, AWS offered two different networking platforms, EC2-Classic and EC2-VPC. EC2-Classic is the first networking platform where all Amazon EC2 is created in a single flat network, sharing connectivity among AWS customers. As of December 2013, AWS only supports EC2-VPC with default VPC created in each Region and a default subnet with a CIDR block of 172.31.0.0/16.\nContent  Subnets Route Table Internet Gateway NAT Gateway  Now we will go through the most basic concepts of VPC in the next sections.\n"

	"content": "Security Group (SG) Some basic features of Security group:\n Only Allow rules can be added, Deny rules cannot be added. Separate rules for outgoing or incoming traffic can be specified. A newly created Security group has no Inbound rules available. Therefore, at the beginning Instance will not allow any traffic to enter, requiring us to add an Inbound rule to allow access. By default, the Security group has an Outbound rule that allows all traffic to go out of the Instance. This rule can be edited (deleted) and added with specific Outbound rules, specifying which traffic originating from the Instance is allowed to go out. If the SG does not have an Outbound rule, then no traffic is allowed to leave the Instance. Security groups is a Stateful service - meaning that if traffic going into the Instance is allowed, then the traffic can also go out of the Instance, and vice versa, regardless of the Outbound rule. Instances can only communicate with each other if and only if they are associated with a Security group that allows connections, or a Security group to which the Instance is associated contains a Rule that allows traffic (except for the default Security group with default rules that allow all traffic to be accessed). Security groups are associated with network interfaces. After the Instance has been initialized, you can still change the Security group assigned to the Instance, which also changes the security group assigned to the corresponding primary network interface.  Security group Rule Rule is generated to grant access to traffic entering or leaving the Instance. This access can be applied to a specific CIDR or to a Security group located in the same VPC or located in another VPC but with a peering connection already initiated.\nBasic components of Security group rule:\n (Inbound rules only) Includes the origin (source) of the traffic and the destination port or port range. The source can be another security group, an IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR range, or simply an IPv4 or IPv6 address. (Outbound rules only) Includes the destination of the traffic and the destination port or destination port range. The destination can be another security group, an IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR range, or simply an IPv4 or IPv6 address, or a service that begins with a prefix (e.g. igw_xxx) in the prefix ID list (a service is identified by the prefix ID - the name and ID of the service available in the region). Every protocol has some standard protocol. Example: SSH is 22, etc.  "

The smallest subnet that can be created is /28 (16 IP addresses). AWS stores the first 4 IP addresses and the last 1 IP address of each subnet for intranet networking purposes. For example, subnet /28 has 16 available IP addresses, but removes 5 reserved IPs for AWS, leaving 11 usable IP addresses for resources operating within this subnet.\nAvailability Zone or abbreviated to AZ is a one or multi data center, located within Region and identified based on geographical location. Within an AZ there can be one or more subnets, but a subnet can only reside in a single AZ and cannot extend to other AZs.\nSubnets are divided into categories such as Public, Private, or VPN-only.\n Public subnet is a subnet with a route table (discussed later) that directs traffic within the subnet to the VPC IGW (discussed later) The Private subnet is the opposite of the Public subnet, which does not have a route table that directs traffic to the VPC IGW. VPN-only subnet is a subnet that has a route table that directs traffic to Amazon VPC\u0026rsquo;s VPG (discussed later).  Regardless of the type of subnet, the subnet\u0026rsquo;s internal IP address range is always private (that is, from outside the Internet it is not possible to directly connect to addresses in this range).\n"

To avoid EC2 resources being used unevenly, (we tend to use AZ a to run primary and AZ b to stand by for example) AWS will randomly assign Availability Zone into Availability Zone ID. We can understand that Availability Zone is a form of alias, and Availability Zone ID is the identifier.

By default, it grants access to all IPv4 or IPv6 traffic that may go in or out of the VPC. Can create a custom network ACL and associate it with a subnet. By default, custom network ACLs deny all incoming and outgoing traffic, until we add an access permission rule. Each subnet in the VPC must be associated with a network ACL. If the subnet is not associated with a specific network ACL, the subnet is automatically associated with the default network ACL. A network ACL can be associated with multiple subnets. However, a subnet can only be associated with one network ACL at a time. When a new network ACL is associated with a subnet, the previous association is deleted. A network ACL contains a list of differently numbered rules. AWS evaluates rules based on their assigned sequence number, starting with the lowest numbered rule, to determine if traffic is allowed in or out of any subnets associated with the network ACLs. . The largest sequence number that can be assigned to a rule is 32766 (equivalent to the maximum number of rules for a network ACL is 32766). The Network ACL has separate entry and exit permission rules and the rule can be to allow or deny traffic. Network ACL is a Stateless service, which means that responses to traffic that are allowed in must follow the rules for outbound traffic (and vice versa).  Network ACL rules You can add or remove a rule from the default network ACL or create a new network ACL for the VPC. When adding or removing a rule from the network ACL, the changes are automatically applied to the subnets associated with it.\nComponents of a network ACL rule:\n Rule number: The starting rule is evaluated starting with the rule with the lowest sequence number. As soon as that rule matches traffic, it will immediately be applied even if it conflicts with a higher-numbered rule in the list. Type: traffic type, eg SSH. All traffic types or custom ranges can be specified. Protocol: specify the protocol with the standard protocol number. Port range: port or port range listening for traffic. For example, HTTP is 80.

	"content": "NAT Gateway   By default, any EC2 running inside a Private subnet will not be able to communicate with the Internet through the IGW. From there the problem arises when that EC2 needs to go outside of the Internet to apply security updates, download patches, or update application software.\n  Understanding that need, AWS provides two methods that allow EC2s inside Private subnet to have access to the Internet, namely NAT Instance and NAT Gateway. For common cases, we should use NAT Gateway instead of NAT Instance. NAT Gateway ensures higher availability and bandwidth and requires less administrative effort than NAT Instance.\n  To create a NAT gateway, you must specify a subnet (public) and an Elastic IP (EIP) address. Make sure the Elastic IP address is not associated with any other Instancs or Network interface.\n  In case we want to migrate from a NAT instance to a NAT gateway, we can reuse the Elastic IP address of the NAT instance. But first, we need to separate the IP address from the NAT Instance.\n  Neither the NAT Gateway nor the NAT instance supports direct inbound traffic from the internet.\n\r"

	"content": "We can connect the On-premise data center to Amazon VPC using a hard or soft VPN depending on the purpose and actual user needs. To establish a Site to Site VPN connection, we will need to create and configure a Virtual Private Gateway (VPG) and Customer Gateway (CGW).\n Virtual Private Gateway (VPG) is a control center that connects the virtual private network (VPN) installed on top of AWS. A Customer Gateway (CGW) is a representation of a hard or soft VPN device installed at the Client end.  VPN tunnel will be established as soon as data traffic is transferred between AWS and the customer\u0026rsquo;s network. In that connection, you must specify the type of routing that will be used to ensure the safety and quality of data transmission. If the CGW on the client-side supports Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), then in the VPN connection configuration we are required to set the routing to dynamic routing. Otherwise, we must configure the connection routing as static routing. In the case of using static routing, you must enter the exact routes needed for the connection from the Client-side to the VPG set up at the AWS end. Also, routing for the VPC must be configured to propagate to allow resources to exchange data in and out of the VPN tunnel connection between AWS and the Customer\u0026rsquo;s network.\nAmazon VPC offers many types of CGWs, and each CGW is assigned to a VPG, but a VPG can be associated with multiple CGWs (many-to-one design). To support this model, the CGW\u0026rsquo;s IP address must be unique within a region. Amazon VPC also provides the necessary information for Network Administrators to be able to configure the CGW and establish a VPN connection to the VPG on AWS. VPN connection always includes two Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) tunnels to ensure high availability of the connection. Below are the important features that we need to know about VPG, CGW, and VPN:\n VPG is the terminal component of the VPN tunnel located on AWS. The CGW can be a hardware device or a software application located at the Client end in the VPN tunnel connection. You must initiate a VPN tunnel connection from CGW to VPG. VPG supports both dynamic routing (BGP) and static routing. VPN connection always has two tunnels to ensure high availability for connection to VPC from the Client site.  The lab helps us learn how to set up a Site to Site VPN connection in AWS. This solution is quite popular due to the advantages of low cost and is easy to configure because AWS provides instructions for each type of device at the Customer end. The customer\u0026rsquo;s only concern is to prepare the internet from which to create a secret secure tunnel (using IPSec) connecting to AWS through an AWS VPN tunnel. In the scope of the lab, assume that we have the Main office (VPC ASG) and Branch office (VPC ASG VPN) located at two VPCs belonging to two different AZs to have a difference in terms of the network. On each VPC doing EC2 creation allows external SSH but without the ability to connect and ping each other using each EC2\u0026rsquo;s Private IP address. All we need to do is configure the VPN so that the Private IP addresses can ping each other using the Site-to-Site VPN.\nContent:\n Create ASG VPN VPC and subnet Configure Site to Site VPN and test connection with private IP   "
